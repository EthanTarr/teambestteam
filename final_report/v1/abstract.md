The bettering the health of our country is a goal of all policymakers, however restrictions confound the fostering of effective change. One of the most contentious policy areas is that of womenâs health, specifically abortion services. In this study, we compiled data across four different sets in order to create a comprehensive foundation for our analysis. During our study, we recognized three distinct themes: Regional Impact, Contributing Factors, and Availability. This was performed across a cross-comparison using a four-state compilation representative of "National Level" data and the State of Illinoisâs metrics. This was to test for granularity bias. 

The trends showed that states which have the *least restrictive, liberal* policies end up measuring some of lowest rates of abortions across time, where the converse (more restrictions leads to higher rates) is true as well. Notably, we saw no difference when testing for granularity bias.
